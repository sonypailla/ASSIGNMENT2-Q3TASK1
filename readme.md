Task 1: Edge Detection using Sobel Filter

Description

This task involves applying edge detection using the Sobel filter on a grayscale image. The script loads an image, applies the Sobel filter in both the x-direction and y-direction, and displays the results.

Requirements

Python

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Matplotlib

Implementation Steps

1.Load a grayscale image.

2.Apply the Sobel filter in the x-direction to detect vertical edges.

3.Apply the Sobel filter in the y-direction to detect horizontal edges.

4.Display the original image and the Sobel-filtered images.

Usage

Run the script in a Python environment
python sobel_edge_detection.py
